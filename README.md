# UrbanPulse

UrbanPulse is a community-driven platform designed to empower citizens to improve their urban environment, starting with public transport.

By enabling residents to document and rate urban elements, UrbanPulse fosters civic engagement and community pride, ensuring that the people who know their city best can have a say in its development.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes with Drizzle ORM & PostgreSQL

## Problems We're Solving

- **Degraded Quality of Life:** Urban environments often worsen rather than enhance life quality.
- **Poor Public Transport Maintenance:** Poorly maintained public transport stops affect millions daily.
- **Lack of Citizen Input:** Lack of citizen input in urban planning leads to misaligned priorities.

## Our Solution

UrbanPulse turns every resident into an agent of change by fostering civic engagement and community pride. The platform allows users to:

- Document and rate urban elements for improvements.
- Facilitate collaboration between citizens, urban planners, and local authorities.
- Engage in a gamified system to encourage civic participation.

## How It Works

1. **User Documentation:** Users can document urban elements such as public transport stops, parks, and other public spaces, providing detailed feedback on their condition and needs.

2. **Rating System:** Users can rate these elements, highlighting areas that need improvement.

3. **Collaboration:** The platform facilitates communication and collaboration between citizens, urban planners, and local authorities, ensuring that the voices of residents are heard.

4. **Gamification:** UrbanPulse employs gamified elements to encourage users to participate actively in the improvement of their urban environment.

## Roadmap

1. **Creation of an Open-Source Transit Infrastructure Database:** Develop a comprehensive database that documents the condition of public transport infrastructure.

2. **Development of Universal Design Standards for Stations:** Establish standards that can be universally applied to ensure consistency and quality across transit stations.

3. **Potential Expansion:** Explore opportunities to expand the platform's focus to other public spaces, such as pedestrian walkwayss, parks and community centers.
